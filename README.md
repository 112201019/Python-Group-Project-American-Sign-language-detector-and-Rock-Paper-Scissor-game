-We uploaded a ZIP version of the whole project just so as not to disturb the folders and paths of all the files because the paths of the files were used in the main code of the project
-To Run the project, you just have to download the ZIP file and extract it.

Description:
  This is a Basic Python project which has two parts:
  Part 1: AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE DETECTOR
      American Sign Language Detector (ASL) was implemented using training (using sklearn module in python) models by using a pre-trained model by giving the input of different hand orientations, 
      It uses the camera of the device to detect the orientation of the hand (using mediapipe module) and gives the prediction of which letter it is associated with that symbol in the ASL.
      All the other details are given in the README.md of the American-Sign-Language-Detector folder.
  Part 2: Rock Paper Scissors Game
      It is a basic game with AI that draws random moves between ROCK PAPER SCISSORS, It uses the same software as part 1 used to detect the hand orientation.
      Further details are given in the README.md of the Rock paper scissor folder.
  Both the parts are integrated with a GUI using Tkinter, for a smooth interface.
